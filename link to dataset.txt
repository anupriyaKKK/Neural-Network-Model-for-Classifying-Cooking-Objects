In the link there is two zip files:

	1- dataset1.2_state_classes.zip:
		This file contains the train and valid set for the state classification challenge which includes 11 state classes in each directory.
		Each sub-directory of the train/ and valid/ directories includes images in that class.

		train/				
		    creamy_paste/
		    diced/	
		    floured/	
		    grated/	
		    juiced/	
		    jullienne/	
		    mixed/	
		    other/	
		    peeled/	
		    sliced/	
		    whole/	

	2- dataset1.2_object_oriented.zip
		This file contains the train and valid set for that includes both object and state annotations. (for example: train/)
		Each train/ and valid/ directories include sub-directories with the state annotations.		(for example: train/diced/)
		Each state sub-directory includes sub-sub-directories of object annotations. 			(for example: train/diced/onion)
		Each object folder includes images in of a specific object and state.				(for example: train/diced/onion/0056.jpg)
		Therefore the 0056.jpg file would be a figure of a diced onion.
